# Introduction 
This repository is my submission for the Technical Assessment of the SAP STAR program.

# Usage
My solutions are written in files `task1.cpp`, `task2.cpp` and `task3.cpp` with C++. Thus, you can copy and paste it into any Online C++ Compilers, or local IDEs such as VisualStudio and CodeBlock. I have put test cases into my code to test, so you don't need to input anything when runing these files.
